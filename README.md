### Thanks for visiting my page

**I will do my best to respond to you, if you have sent me a message. Kindly wait. Thank you!**
 
I am an 18-year-old currently studying at the Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science. I also write, make websites (that's mostly what I do here!), videos, and other visual art. Mantas works on client and open source projects (see @cstate and other projects of mine below).

### Consider supporting me

The support from @cstate both morally and financially is very much appreciated as I am learning to live on my own, studying, and trying to keep up with my passions.
